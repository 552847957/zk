In this model, a page is self-contained and the minimal unit to communicate between clients and servers.</p><p>
</p><div><img src="images/20000081000027E400002C36A98C01AF.jpg"></div><p>As the Web has emerged as the default platform for application development, this model faces a substantial challenge: the inability to visually represent the complexities in today's applications. For example, to give a customer a quotation, you might have to open another page to search his trading records, another page for the recent prices, and another page for current stocking. Users are forced to leave the page he is working on, and navigate among several pages. It is easy to get lost and confused, and the result is unhappy customers, lost sales and low productivities.</p><p>The challenge to develop a modern application upon this page-based model is also substantial. In this model, applications running at the server have to take care everything from parsing the request, rendering the response, routing processes that link users from one page to another, and handling versatile errors made by users. Tens of frameworks, such as Struct, Tapestry and JSF, are then emerged to simplify this development process. Due to the huge gap between the page-based model and the modern applications, learning and using these frameworks is never a pleasant process, not to mention intuition or simplicity.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch01.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch01.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch01s02.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">1.
