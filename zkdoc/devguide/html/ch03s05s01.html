This assignment happens even if the component is not attached to a page. It means that any component you created in an event listener can be used in the same desktop that the listener is handling.</p><p>When a component is created in a thread other than any event listener, it doesn't belong to any desktop. In this case, you could attach to any desktop you want as long as the attachment occurs in a proper event listener. Of course, once the component is attached to a desktop, it belongs to the desktop forever.</p><p>For most applications, it is rarely necessary to create components in a thread other than event listeners. However, if you have a long operation, you might want to execute it in a background thread. Then, you could prepare the component tree at the background and then add it to a desktop when a proper event is received. Refer to the Long Operations section in the Event Listening and Processing chapter.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch03s05.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch03s05.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch03s06.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Desktops and Event Processing </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> ZUML and XML Namespaces</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
