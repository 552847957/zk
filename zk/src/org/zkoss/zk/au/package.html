	<p>Commands used to communicate between client and server, called
	asynchronous updates.
	Application developers rarely need to know them. Rather, use
	<a href="../ui/util/Clients.html">org.zkoss.zk.ui.util.Clients</a>
	instead.</p>

	<p>Note: commands in this package is not what an application developer
	handles. Rather, use the <a href="../ui/event/package-summary.html">org.zkoss.zk.event</a> package.
