 * An extra interface implemented by an interpreter ({@link Interpreter})
 * if it supports the hierachical scopes.
 *
 * <p>By supporting the hierachical scopes we mean the interpreter
 * associates one interpreter-dependent scope with each ZK's
 * {@link Namespace}. And, variables, classes and methods defined
 * in zscript are then stored in an individual scope depending on
 * the namespace when calling {@link Interpreter#interpret}.
 *
 * <p>On the other hand, if the interpreter doesn't support the hierachical
 * scopes, it maintains only one global scope and all variables, classes
 * and functions are defined in the global scope.
