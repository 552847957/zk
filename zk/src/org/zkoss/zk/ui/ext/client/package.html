</head>
<body>
	Additional Interfaces that might be implemented by the returned object
	of <a href="../../sys/ComponentCtrl.html#getExtraCtrl()">getExtraCtrl</a>.
	ZK Update Engine uses them to update the content of a component caused by
	user's activity at the client.
	In other words, it means a component's content is controlled by the client.

	<p>Application developers need NOT to access any of them.</p>
