	//Execution/request//
	/** The execution attribute used to control how to {@link org.zkoss.zk.ui.sys.PageCtrl#redraw}
	 * a page. There are three different values: <code>destkop</code>,
	 * <code>page</code>, and <code>complete</code>.
	 *
	 * <p>Default: null (means auto). In other words, <code>desktop</code> is assumed
	 * if this is the top-level page and not being included (and other conditions).
	 * Otherwise, it assumes <code>page</code>.
	 *
	 * <p>Application developers rarely need to set this attribute, unless ZK Loader
	 * cannot decide which control to use correctly.
	 *
	 * <p>If you prefer to draw the desktop with the page, you can set the
	 * vallue to <code>desktop</code>. By drawing the desktop, it means HTML and BODY
	 * tags will be generated, too.
	 *
	 * <p>If you prefer to draw the page only (such as being included),
	 * you can set the value to <code>page</code>.
	 *
	 * <p>If the page already contains everything that the client expects such
	 * as the HTML and BODY tags, you can set the value to <code>complete</code>.
	 *
	 * <p>The difference between <code>page</code> and <code>complete</code> is
	 * a bit subtle. They don't generate HTML and BODY tags. However,
	 * <code>page</code> generates DIV to represents a page, while
	 * <code>complete</code> generates only the root components.
	 * Thus, <code>complete</code> is usually used for the situation that
	 * HTML and BODY are being generated by other technology, while
	 * <code>page</code> for a included ZK page.
	 *
	 * <p>Note: if {@link org.zkoss.zk.ui.Page#isComplete} is true, it has the same effect
	 * of setting {@link #PAGE_REDRAW_CONTROL} to <code>complete</code>.
