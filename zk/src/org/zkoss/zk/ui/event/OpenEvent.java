/**
 * Represents an event cause by user's openning or closing
 * something at the client.
 *
 * <p>Note: it is a bit confusing but {@link Events#ON_CLOSE} is sent when
 * user clicks a close button. It is a request to ask the server
 * to close a window, a tab or others. If the server ignores the event,
 * nothing will happen at the client. By default, the component is
 * detached when receiving this event.
 *
 * <p>On the other hand, {@link Events#ON_OPEN} (with {@link OpenEvent}) is
 * a notification. It is sent to notify the server that the client has
 * opened or closed something.
 * And, the server can not prevent the client from opening or closing.
