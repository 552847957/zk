<body>
	<p>Additional Interfaces that might be implemented by the returned object
of getExtraCtrl().
ZK Update Engine uses them to update the content of a component caused by
	user's activity at the client.
In other words, it means a component's content is controlled by the client.</p>

	<p>See <a href="../../sys/ComponentCtrl.html#getExtraCtrl()">getExtraCtrl</a>
	for details</p>

	<p>Application developers need NOT to access any of them.</p>
