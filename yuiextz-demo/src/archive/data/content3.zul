		KOKO Petroleum, Inc. announced today that its operator for the
		Corsicana Field, JMT Resources, Ltd. ("JMT") will commence a
		re-work program on its Pecan Gap wells in the next week. The
		re-work program will consist of drilling six lateral bore
		production strings from the existing well bore. This process,
		known as Radial Jet Enhancement, will utilize high pressure
		fluids to drill the lateral well bores, which will extend out
		approximately 350' each.JMT has contracted with Well Enhancement
		Services, LLC (www.wellenhancement.com) to perform the rework on
		its Pierce nos. 14 and 14a. A small sand frac will follow the
		drilling of the lateral well bores in order to enhance
		permeability and create larger access to the Pecan Gap
		reservoir. Total cost of the re-work per well is estimated to be
		approximately $50,000 USD.Parab?ns!
